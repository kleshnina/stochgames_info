All computations and simulations were performed with Matlab R2021b and Wolfram Mathematica 12.3. 

Files for Matlab R2021b:
1. To calculate the payoffs for given parameter values, use CalcPayoff.m
2. CalSMEquilibrium functions calculate the strategy distribution at an evolurionary equilibrium and the corresponding cooperation rates. 
3. SimEvolution functions calculate dynamic evolutionary process for given parameter values.

Files for Wolfram Mathematica 12.3:
Stochastic Games_payoffs.nb calculates analytical expressions for the cooperation rates for the no-selection limit.
